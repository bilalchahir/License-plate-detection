# License-plate-detection-and-recognition
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for real-time license plate detection and recognition using TensorFlow Lite, an A133 electronic card, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.

Components and Methodology:

License Plate Detection:

Utilizing TensorFlow Lite, a deep learning-based model will be deployed for real-time license plate detection. The model will be trained to identify and localize license plates within images or video streams.
A133 Electronic Card Integration:

The A133 electronic card will serve as a dedicated hardware component to enhance processing capabilities and optimize the efficiency of the license plate detection algorithm.
OCR for Plate Recognition:

Once the license plates are detected, an OCR engine will extract the alphanumeric characters from the plates. TensorFlow Lite's inference capabilities will process the extracted data for license plate recognition.
Integration and Real-Time Processing:

The components will be integrated into a cohesive system that can process live video streams or images captured by a camera in real-time. The system will execute license plate detection, recognition, and display the identified license plate information.
